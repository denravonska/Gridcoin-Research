# Gridcoin DPOR
A work-in-progress port of the VB.NET Neural Network to .NET Core. The aim of this project is to create a cross-platform version of the existing Neural Network with some added performance improvements and the ability to remove the Gridcoin Team Requirement.

Still TODO:
- C++ Bridge
- Only process stats if beacon data or Last-Modified on a stats file has changed.
- Lots of testing.

## Improvements
- The Team Requirement has been removed when running commands with the `-noteam` switch. 
- Code has been stripped back from what is in the original .NET repo.
- The remote xml files are only downloaded if they have been changed putting less load on the BOINC project servers.
- The data is now stored in a SQLite database instead of flat files.
- CPIDS are only stored in the DB if they exist in the beacon data.
- CPIDS are filtered by > 32 days via Last-Modified in the XML file header instead of local time. 
- Neural Hashes of distributed nodes should match more often.
- When a project fails to download stats the magnitudes of users in other projects will no longer rise.
- Project stats are downloaded more often than 24 hours because of how frequent they can change. The Last-Modified header is used to determine if the full data of the file should be downloaded.
- Stored data is never cleaned our and started from scratch. The differences are changed when a stats file is newer and then magnitudes are re-calculated. This reduces IO on the system.

## Commands available
Here is the list of commands available when the binary is built as a self-contained app named `gridcoindpor`

### SyncDPOR
This command downloads all the BOINC project files and calculates magnitudes storing them in the **/GridcoinResearch/DPOR/db.sqlite** folder.

```bash
gridcoindpor -gridcoindatadir=C:\\Users\\3ullShark\\AppData\\Roaming\\GridcoinResearch -syncdpor2=SYNCDATAXML
```

### NeuralHash
This command gets the neural hash of the calculated magnitude contract. 

```bash
gridcoindpor -gridcoindatadir=C:\\Users\\3ullShark\\AppData\\Roaming\\GridcoinResearch -neuralhash
```

Adding the `-noteam` switch will get the neural hash of the contract containing calculations without the Gridcoin team requirement.

### NeuralContract
This command gets the calculated magnitude contract. 

```bash
gridcoindpor -gridcoindatadir=C:\\Users\\3ullShark\\AppData\\Roaming\\GridcoinResearch -neuralcontract
```

Adding the `-noteam` switch will get the the contract containing calculations without the Gridcoin team requirement.

## How to Build the Source
With .NET Core being cross-platform it's possible to develop on Windows, Linux and Mac and build the source on any platform. It is recommended you use the free cross-platform editor called [Visual Studio Code][1] to make changes.

Before you begin you will need to install the .NET Core SDK for your platform. Head over to the [.NET Core website][3] to find out how.

To build a self-contained executable (`gridcoindpor`) that can be copied into the GridcoinResearch program folder navigate to the **/src/GridcoinDPOR** folder and then run the following at the command prompt:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet publish -c Release -r [RuntimeIdentifier]
```

**Note: replace [RuntimeIdentifier] with one of the target applications specified in `<RuntimeIdentifiers>` of the GridcoinDPOR.csproj file.

For example to cross-compile a Linux binary from another OS run the following:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r ubuntu.16.04-x64
```

This will copy the files to **/src/GridcounDPOR/bin/Release/netcoreapp1.1/[RuntimeIdentifier]/publish** folder.

## How to Debug
In order to step through the code with the debugger in Visual Studio Code you will need to do the following.

**Step 1:** Modify the **launch.json** file located in the **.vscode** directory so that the `args` field has the path to your GridcoinResearch data folder and the command you want to run. For example. 

```json
"args": ["-gridcoindatadir=C:\\Users\\3ullShark\\AppData\\Roaming\\GridcoinResearch", "-syncdpor2", "-debug"],
```

*Note: when using the `-debug` switch with the `-syncdpor2` command `Program.cs` will load the sample sync data XML file that is currently passed to the VB.NET Code in the current implementation. This file is located in **/src/GridcoinDPOR/syncdpor.dat**.* 

**Step 2:** Put a breakpoint in `Program.cs` or anywhere else in the code and press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start debugging.

## How to Run the Unit Tests
Navigate to the **test/GridcoinDPOR.Tests** directory and then it the command prompt/terminal run the following:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet test
```

## Executing from C++
Currently the .NET Code can be executed from C++ by spawning a process and getting the contents of the output. However it is possible to host .NET Core in C++ and communicate directly with managed code but it is a lot more work to setup. Here is an example of C++ code that can be used to spawn the .NET Core process:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

std::string exec(const char* cmd) {
    char buffer[128];
    std::string result = "";
    FILE* pipe = popen(cmd, "r");
    if (!pipe) throw std::runtime_error("popen() failed!");
    try {
        while (!feof(pipe)) {
            if (fgets(buffer, 128, pipe) != NULL)
                result += buffer;
        }
    } catch (...) {
        pclose(pipe);
        throw;
    }
    pclose(pipe);
    return result;
}

int main()
{   
    std::string result = exec("dotnet GridcoinDPOR.dll -gridcoindatadir=\"C:\\Users\\3ullShark\\AppData\\Roaming\\GridcoinResearch\" -syncdpor2=[SYNCDATAXML]");
    std::cout << result;
    return 0;
}
```
